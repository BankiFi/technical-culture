# Design

> “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” –Steve Jobs

> “Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent.” –Joe Sparano

> “If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design.” –Ralf Speth

We'll be honest - we're getting used to doing this regularly across our projects. The theory is if it's designed well from the beginning, there's less refactoring and expensive code changes to make down the line and a better chance of having a great product the first time round.

## Motivations

We've observed it takes a phenomenal amount of brain power and smarts to sketch out and recommend an architecture with a "wishy-washy" vision. Don't get us wrong it's amazing that people can do this, but that starts to become a bottle neck. We want to make this a commodity expertise amongst our team.

More importantly, we want to build things that __matter__. Everything should be built for a purpose, and solve a problem that needs to be solved.

## The Design Mindset

- What is it?
  - A different perspective of the world and things that exist
  - Set of principles you live by when designing
- Usability is important
  - [Donald Norman's 10 Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) are a great place to start
  - Not everyone has 'perfect' senses
  - Many people are short-signted or colour blind
  - N.B. other disabilities
  - Think about what the person really wants to do
- Design responsibly
  - Your creations may live on for many years to come
  - Over-engineering and over-designing presents more problems than it solves
- Explore all possibilities
  - There's always another option
  - You'll have some bad ideas before finding a good one
- There's a reason for everything
  - Don't stop at "she doesn't like it" - investigate further, why doesn't she like it?
  - Make sure you've found the problem, not the symptom
- Spot the patterns
  - Five people are enough to spot a design pattern
- Create what they need, not what they want

## Tutorials and Resources
Tutorials and resources that you can use to become a better designer.  

- General Resources
  - [UX Tools](https://uxtools.co) - start here!
  - [UX Checklist](https://uxchecklist.github.io/) - something for every part of the process
- Colours, fonts and styles
  - [Color Hexa](http://www.colorhexa.com/87ceeb) - setting your colour palette
    - We think it should be `Colour Hexa` #britishproblems
- Icons
  - [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) - we've used this more, start here
  - [icon8](https://icons8.com/) - an alternative to investigate
  - [thenounproject](https://thenounproject.com/) - another alternative, nearly one million curated icons
- Processes and Books
  - [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/)
    - It's both a process and a book. Highly recommended.
  - [Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/0465050654)
    - Changes your perspective about products and things you use
    - Can't recommend this enough
  - [Jobs, Pains and Gains](http://blog.strategyzer.com/posts/2016/7/20/how-to-capture-customer-jobs-pains-gains-that-arent-subjective)
    - Yes, it's a "business tool"
    - It's a great way to consolidate what we know about our target market!

## Starting a Project

- Every project should have a Design Brief
  - Check the [template](#design-brief-template) below
  - This is similar to a Statement of Work
- Establish a [Style Tile](http://styletil.es/)
  - Not all project require a style tile
  - This should help you develop and establish your brand identity
  - Ensure the design language translates to all facets of your brand
- Identify who your target market is!
  - Rule #1 is to know who you're designing and building for
  - You can track these with personas
  - There are many ways to generate and develop personas
  - Jobs, pains and gains is a rapid way to do this

## Designing a feature

- List out the [Jobs to be Done](https://jtbd.info/)
  - These should compile down to a set of discrete tasks
  - Try to avoid phrasing them as CRUD operations
- Perform a [Hierarchical Task Analysis](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/02/hierarchical-task-analysis.php)
  - Each one should be device and interface independent
  - This establishes the blueprint for a Job to be Done
- Search for existing inspiration
  - This can be existing similar tools and products
  - You can borrow from completely unrelated objects and services too
  - Avoid copying; you need to be innovating
- Sketch the concepts
  - Stick to pencil and paper, everyone can contribute
    - [POP](https://marvelapp.com/pop/) will be useful here
  - Think of this as your "concept car"
  - Big picture and small picture thinking

## Prototype versus Build

- When to prototype?
  - You're not sure this is the right feature or idea
  - You need to demonstrate your USP (Unique Selling Point)
- When to build?
  - Feature or idea is generally battle tested in other forms already
  - A working product is more valuable than a demonstration
  - It's almost as quick to build as it is to prototype!
