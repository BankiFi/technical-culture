# Design
We'll be honest - we're getting used to doing this regularly across our projects. The theory is if it's designed well from the beginning, there's less refactoring and expensive code changes to make down the line.

## Motivations
We've observed it takes a phenomenal amount of brain power and smarts to sketch out and recommend an architecture with a "wishy-washy" vision. Don't get us wrong it's amazing that people can do this, but that starts to become a bottle neck. We want to make this a commodity expertise amongst our team.

More importantly, we want to build things that __matter__. Everything should be built for a purpose, and solve a problem that needs to be solved.

## Tutorials
Tutorials and resources that you can use to become a better designer.  

- // FIXME: are there any useful tutorials we can use?
- General Resources
  - [UX Tools](https://uxtools.co) - start here!
  - [UX Checklist](https://uxchecklist.github.io/) - something for every part of the process
- Colours, fonts and styles
  - [Color Hexa](http://www.colorhexa.com/87ceeb) - setting your colour palette
    - We think it should be `Colour Hexa` #britishproblems
- Processes and Books
  - [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/)
    - It's both a process and a book. Highly recommended.
  - [Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/0465050654)
    - Changes your perspective about products and things you use
    - Can't recommend this enough
  - [Jobs, Pains and Gains](http://blog.strategyzer.com/posts/2016/7/20/how-to-capture-customer-jobs-pains-gains-that-arent-subjective)
    - Yes, it's a "business tool"
    - It's a great way to consolidate what we know about our target market! 

## The Basics

- Every project should have a Design Brief
