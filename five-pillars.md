## Vision & Values

- Our business is about people capital, not venture capital
- Reach beyond your expectations, every day
- First names are important, job titles are not
- Trusting each other is the platform for everything we do
- Everyone practices humility and self awareness, but also self-esteem
- We know the mentality to be successful and we have it in abundance

## Culture

- No office hours, but minds always open
- 40 hours a week maximum; 32 summer hours (4 day weeks) July & August
- Weekend starts 1pm Friday
- Pay for one weekend holiday a year
- Fresh fruit breakfast in the office every day; pay for a weekly ‘Hello Fresh’ shop once a month
- Team social last Thursday of every month

## Knowledge

- Everyone has a personal R&D project
- Host Lunch & Learns third Thursday in the month
- Run four hackathons a year
- Wednesday afternoon is your personal learning time
- Everyone goes to one event a month; everyone has a monthly book allowance
- Performance of the business is transparent to everyone

## Social impact

## Success

- We will keep our company small and intimate, with reasonable expectations
- Our place of work is a welcoming oasis, not a chaotic kitchen
- Anxiety is not a prerequisite for progress
- We are calm by choice and practice
- Everything is about having a reasonable day, going home, and living your life
- Success is looking at a visible horizon, and getting there in the long run
